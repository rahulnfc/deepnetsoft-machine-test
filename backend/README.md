Hi there,

To use this project, you need to install the dependencies.
---> npm install or yarn

Then, you can run the server.

Then, you need to create a .env file with the following variables:

# Path: backend/.env

                # Environment variables
                PORT
                MONGODB_URI
                JWT_SECRET

                # Example
                PORT=3000
                MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/my-project
                JWT_SECRET=my-secret-key

That's all!
